### Database Planning

I used Lucidchart to create my database entity relationship diagrams. Below you can see how each model relates to eachother [Database Diagram](static/images/database_digram_for_blog_post.jpg)


## Agile Methodology for project planning

I used agile methodology for the first time when planning full-stack django website with a focus on delivering the basic functionalities. I prioritized features by labeling them as "must-have" or "could-have" and moved some less critical ones to future development. To guide my development process, I created user stories for both the admin user and regular visitors. These stories helped to define the features and functionalities that were most important to project's target audience.

As a solo developer who was learning a lot during development, I faced challenges in estimating the time required for each tasks, bugs and only had a basic concept of what I would create. Therefore, I kept things simple and focused on achievable goals. As the project grew, I was able to add more advanced features and group user stories are meant to mark significant points in time in terms of project completion.

To keep track of progress, I used a kanban board divided into following sections: "to do", "in progress" "done",  and "bugs" that allowed to visualize all tasks and prioritize next steps.[Click here](https://github.com/users/suba-suresh/projects/4/views/1)

By using agile methodology, I was able to stay organized and focused on delivering the most important features, while also allowing flexibility for future development

## Testing and Validation

### Responsiveness

I tested the website for responsiveness using Chrome's Developer Tools. Screenshots were captured to demonstrate how the design adapts across different devices, including mobile, tablet, and laptop. Below are some key features of the responsive design:

- **Navbar**: The navbar collapses into a burger menu on smaller screen sizes to ensure easy navigation.
- **Masthead Image**: The masthead image is hidden on smaller screen sizes to maintain a clean and focused layout.
- **Content Layout**: Content stacks vertically rather than horizontally on smaller screens to optimize readability and usability.
- **Blog Post Cards**: On smaller screens, fewer blog post cards are visible on the homepage to ensure a responsive and accessible design.

Screenshots demonstrating these features can be found in the [Screenshots](static/images/screenshots/) section of the documentation.

### Validation
- I used the [W3 HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to check the HTML on each of my site pages by Direct Input. I have resolved the necessary errors.
  ![HTML validation results](/static/images/screenshots/html-validation.png)  
  
- I used the [W3 CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/) to check my CSS script by Direct Input. I found no errors! There are 7 warnigns which are just flagging vendor extensions. ![CSS validation results](/static/images/screenshots/css-validation.png)  
  
- I used the [CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/) to check all my python scripts. I found a few small errors like the below - mostly lines were too long or there was a missing blank space line. I have left some of the error messages as they are related to a too long line at the result of a comment. ![Python Linter Result](/static/images/screenshots/Python-validation.png)

## Known Bugs
- **Image Upload Issue:** Conflicts with image handling on the Profile page.
- ** Moderation:**  slow to update when delete the comments and likes.
